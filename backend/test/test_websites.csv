Meatballs,https://natashaskitchen.com/juicy-meatball-recipe/,"Makes 24 Meatballs
3 slices white bread, crusts removed, diced
2/3 cup milk or cold water
1 lb lean ground beef, 85/15 fat content
1 lb ground pork
1/4 cup parmesan cheese, shredded
1 large egg
3 garlic cloves, minced
2 Tbsp parsley, finely chopped
1 tsp sea salt
1/2 tsp black pepper
2 Tbsp olive oil, to sautée","How to Make Meatballs:
Combine diced bread in a large bowl with 2/3 cup milk or water. Soak for 5 minutes then mash with a fork. Meanwhile, prepare the remaining ingredients.
Into the bowl of mashed bread crumbs, add ground beef, ground pork, 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 1 egg, 3 minced garlic cloves, 2 Tbsp parsley, 1 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp black pepper. Use your hands to stir the mixture together just until well combined. Do not overmix.
Portion onto a lined baking sheet (about 2 Tbsp per meatball – an ice cream scoop makes it easy). With wet hands, roll meatballs into 1 1/2" diameter balls.
How to Cook Meatballs:

To Sautée: Heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat. Add 2 Tbsp oil. Once the oil is hot, add meatballs to the skillet, placing them in one at a time, and cook in batches to get a good sear. Sautée, turning every 2 minutes (total 6-8 minutes), or until evenly browned and the internal temperature reaches 160˚F on an instant-read thermometer. Serve as is or in any recipe that calls for meatballs.
To Bake Meatballs: Place on a lined baking sheet 2" apart and bake in a fully preheated oven at 400˚F for 20-23 minutes, or until fully cooked and the centers reach 160˚F. If you want golden brown meatballs, broil for the last 2-3 minutes.

All butter pie crust,https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/all-butter-pie-crust/,"2 and 1/2 cups (313g) all-purpose flour, plus more as needed (spooned & leveled)
2 teaspoons granulated sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup (16 Tbsp; 226g) unsalted butter, chilled and cubed
1/2 cup (120ml) ice water, plus more as needed","In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt together. Add the cold cubed butter on top. Using a pastry cutter, food processor, or two forks (pastry cutter is ideal, see post above), cut or pulse the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles coarse meal. You’re looking for pea-sized bits of flour-coated butter. A few larger bits of butter is OK.

Drizzle the cold water over the surface of the flour mixture, 1 Tablespoon at a time, and stir after each addition. Stop adding water when the dough comes together easily and begins to form large clumps. The dough will feel moist and a little sticky, but not feel overly wet. Do not add any more water than you need to. I always use about 1/2 cup (120ml) of ice water.
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface. Using floured hands, gently bring the dough mixture together into a ball. Avoid overworking the dough. If it feels too dry or is too crumbly to form a ball, dip your fingers in cold water and then continue bringing the dough together. If it feels too sticky, sprinkle on a little more flour and continue bringing it together. Using a sharp knife or bench scraper, divide the dough in half. Using your hands, gently flatten each half into a 1-inch-thick disc.
Wrap each disc tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 5 days before using in a pie recipe.
After refrigerating, the dough is ready to roll out and use in a pie recipe. Proceed with the pie per your recipe’s instructions. TIP: When rolling out the chilled pie dough discs, use gentle force with your rolling pin. Start from the center of the disc and work your way out in all directions, turning the dough with your hands between rolls. Smooth out the edges if you notice cracks. (See video.) Keeping your work surface, rolling pin, and hands lightly floured makes rolling out easier.",False
