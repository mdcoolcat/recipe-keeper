Nut-Free Vegan Tahini Chocolate Chip Cookies,https://www.instagram.com/reels/DKqwfMmNyIv/,"(makes 10 cookies)
250g white beans, rinsed and with water squeezed out (weigh after squeezing water out - so it might be 1 x 400g can + a bit)
1/2 cup tahini (well-stirred, not too runny)
1/4 cup maple syrup
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tbsp lemon juice
1 tsp baking powder
1/8 tsp salt
3/4 cup vegan dark chocolate chips or chopped chocolate","1. Rinse and drain the white beans well, then squeeze water out of them dry with paper towels. Then weigh 250g.
2. In a food processor, blend all ingredients except the chocolate chips until completely smooth, scraping down the sides as needed.
3. Transfer the batter to a bowl and fold in the chocolate chips.
4. Chill the dough in the fridge for 60 minutes to help the cookies hold their shape.
5. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
6. Scoop the dough onto a lined baking sheet using a small ice cream scoop or tablespoon, spacing them apart. I get about 10 cookies. Note: if you use parchment paper they will spread less than if you use a silicone sheet.
7. Add extra chocolate chips on top if you like.
8. Bake for 17–19 minutes, or until lightly golden bits appear on top.
9. These cookies come out soft and need plenty of time to cool and set. Let them cool on the baking tray for 10–15 minutes before carefully transferring to a wire rack to cool overnight to set firmly - the longer the more set.",description

397 Cal Air Fryer Cheesy Garlic Breadsticks,https://www.instagram.com/reels/DRfJ774kdAt/,"Ingredients for Dough:
45g Self Rising Flour (can sub with AP Flour but just sub in a big pinch of salt and 3g baking powder)
8g Coconut Flour
3g Nutritional Yeast
Garlic Powder (don’t be shy with it)
100g Plain Non Fat Greek Yogurt
48g Egg Whites

Toppings:
56g Part Skim Mozzarella (Rinsed in cold water for cheese pulls)
6g Parmesan
Garlic Powder
Dried Oregano
Dried Basil
","1. Add your dry ingredients into your bowl and mix to avoid clumping. Then add your wet ingredients and mix till you get a thick paste consistency.
2. Measure out your air fryer to see how big of a pizza can fit. Mine is 10x10 inches so I cut a piece of parchment that big.
3. Add dough to the middle of a big piece of parchment paper. You want to spread this crust to as big of the parchment in a rectangle as you can. The spread of the crust is a skill you will get better at over time but the premise is spreading from the inside out.
4. Now carefully add the parchment with the crust on it to your air fryer and air fry on 400 degrees F for 5 minutes or until crust is golden.
5. Then flip the crust and take the parchment paper off. Air fry on that side for another 3 minutes.
6. Now flip the crust back over to the top and add all your toppings.
7. Air fry for another 3-4 minutes or until the toppings are golden. Then once done, slice up and enjoy!",description
