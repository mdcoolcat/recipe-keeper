Nut-Free Vegan Tahini Chocolate Chip Cookies,https://www.instagram.com/reels/DKqwfMmNyIv/,"(makes 10 cookies)
250g white beans, rinsed and with water squeezed out (weigh after squeezing water out - so it might be 1 x 400g can + a bit)
1/2 cup tahini (well-stirred, not too runny)
1/4 cup maple syrup
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tbsp lemon juice
1 tsp baking powder
1/8 tsp salt
3/4 cup vegan dark chocolate chips or chopped chocolate","1. Rinse and drain the white beans well, then squeeze water out of them dry with paper towels. Then weigh 250g.
2. In a food processor, blend all ingredients except the chocolate chips until completely smooth, scraping down the sides as needed.
3. Transfer the batter to a bowl and fold in the chocolate chips.
4. Chill the dough in the fridge for 60 minutes to help the cookies hold their shape.
5. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
6. Scoop the dough onto a lined baking sheet using a small ice cream scoop or tablespoon, spacing them apart. I get about 10 cookies. Note: if you use parchment paper they will spread less than if you use a silicone sheet.
7. Add extra chocolate chips on top if you like.
8. Bake for 17–19 minutes, or until lightly golden bits appear on top.
9. These cookies come out soft and need plenty of time to cool and set. Let them cool on the baking tray for 10–15 minutes before carefully transferring to a wire rack to cool overnight to set firmly - the longer the more set."
